## 2021 IMI Big Data & Artificial Intelligence Case Competition

Our team developed and presented an AI-driven anomaly detection system to identify high-risk user accounts within large-scale financial transaction datasets. The system combined clustering algorithms with neural networks to enhance compliance monitoring and reduce regulatory risk.

### Approach

- Designed and implemented an end-to-end anomaly detection pipeline integrating:

- Clustering algorithms for unsupervised pattern discovery.

- Neural networks for high-accuracy classification.

- Processed and analyzed large-scale financial transaction datasets to detect potentially suspicious activity.

### Key Results

- Achieved 80% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline detection rates.

- Demonstrated the potential of AI to reduce investigative workload and minimize regulatory risk.

- Presented actionable insights to compliance teams and business leads, highlighting operational benefits.

### Repository Structure

- ***aml_design_features.ipynb*** – Feature engineering to create variables that capture transactional behavior patterns relevant to AML detection.

- ***aml_neural_network_classification.ipynb*** – Neural network–based classification model to identify high-risk accounts.

- ***aml_preprocessing_script.ipynb*** – Data preprocessing and cleaning, including handling missing values and standardizing transaction data.
